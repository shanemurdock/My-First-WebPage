	<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>My name is Shane Murdock. I was a very lazy child growning up, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and drinking, When i hit 16 I started boxing
		I only had one fight and lost. From this I joined kickboxing with my two brothers, Keving and David. I trained for 5 years and won 3 competitions. 
		On Monday's I eat like a Pascatarian... that means I only eat fish and vegitables.
		After School I worked for HP doing first second lever support, from there i joined the army where I've been for the past 8 years. 
		Through this I have competed in numberous races with my family Hell and back twice, 
		Womens mini marathon twice and I done the the Dublin marathon race series last year.</p>
